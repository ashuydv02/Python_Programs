## Description

This repository is a comprehensive collection of practice projects and scripts that I have developed to enhance my skills in the following areas:

- **Core Python Programming:** Fundamental Python scripts to reinforce basic concepts.
- **NumPy:** Programs utilizing NumPy for numerical computations.
- **Pandas:** Scripts that perform data manipulation and analysis using Pandas.
- **Django:** Web development projects using the Django framework.
- **Django Rest Framework (DRF):** RESTful API development with Django Rest Framework.
- **AJAX:** Web applications implementing AJAX for asynchronous data handling.

## Installation

To run these programs locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ashuydv02/Python_Programs.git
    cd Python_Programs
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    - On Windows:

      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - On macOS/Linux:

      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

4. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Each folder in this repository contains a set of scripts or a project related to a specific topic.
To run a script, navigate to the appropriate directory and execute the Python file.

Example command to run a Python script:
  python filename.py

For Django projects, navigate to the project directory and use:
  python manage.py runserver
